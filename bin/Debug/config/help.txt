Important: 
1.When run in remote server model, ATester won't check if the test/BPT in the To be run list is right, will execute them directly.
2.Don't use the STOP or Close button frequently,suggest to run a whole round, because ATester is using API of UFT/QTP to run test, so close/kill the thread is not very safe for the tool, it may cause unexpected problem and make the ATest and UFT/QTP crash.
